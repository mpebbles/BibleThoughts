Application is intended to provide a saveable workspace for scriptural reflection.

I am still playing with the idea. This will most likey be a long-term project, and
does not have a clear-cut objective, other than being an aid for organizing, referencing,
and annotating various translations of Scripture.

I intend to build a react-app deployed to Heroku in the beginning, and possibly a Flutter 
application if I am happy with the initial project.
